# Rectangle Area and Perimeter Calculation

This program allows the user to input the length and breadth of a rectangle, and calculates both the area and perimeter of the rectangle.

## Problem Description

The program should have methods `Area()` and `Perimeter()` in the `Rectangle` type to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle respectively. The area and perimeter are calculated using the following formulas:

- **Area**: `Area = length * width`
- **Perimeter**: `Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)`

### Method Signatures:
- `Area() int`
- `Perimeter() int`

## Example

### Input:
```
10 20
```

### Output:
```
Area of Rectangle: 200
Perimeter of Rectangle: 60
```
