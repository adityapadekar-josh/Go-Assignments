# Problem Statement

We are going to build an application that is meant to be a sort of status checker for some common websites that exist online. The application continuously polls the status of these websites and exposes APIs to retrieve the information.

## Requirements

### 1. Expose an API to submit lists of websites to monitor

- Implement an HTTP server and expose it on a port eg: 3000
- Expose an API endpoint (hint: POST /websites) and accept the list of websites in the request body as an array
- Save the list of websites in an in-memory map.

### 2. Monitor the status of all submitted websites every 1 minute

- Create a go routine which loops over all the websites and checks if they are responding to HTTP traffic (hint: status code 200). If yes, the website can be considered as UP, otherwise DOWN. Once the status check is done for all websites, sleep for 1 minute and continue this process forever.
- Status checks of N websites can be done concurrently using goroutines to improve performance.
- The status of each website can be saved in the same in-memory map where the list was stored.

### 3. Expose an API to get the status of all websites

- Expose an API endpoint (hint: GET /websites) which returns an array of websites with their current status
- Support a query parameter in API (hint: GET /websites?name=www.facebook.com) which then returns the status of the given website

## Requirements (Good to have)

### 1. Use of Golang interface to check the status of the website

- Today we are relying on the HTTP status code of a website to determine whether it's up or not. Tomorrow, we could use some external third-party service for the same. Hence we could write up an interface to do the status check. Currently, it will use the HTTP implementation which can be switched later to an advanced implementation.
- Below given is a sample for your reference. However, feel free to use your own names and signature.

```go
type StatusChecker interface {
    Check(ctx context.Context, name string) (status bool, err error)
}

type httpChecker struct {
}

func (h httpChecker) Check(ctx context.Context, name string) (status bool, err error) {
    // your implementation to check status using HTTP call
    return
}
```

## Sample Input (for POST /websites)

```json
{
  "websites": ["www.google.com", "www.facebook.com", "www.fakewebsite1.com"]
}
```

## Sample Response (for POST /websites)

```
200 OK
```

## Sample Input (for GET /websites)

- Query param (optional): ?name=www.facebook.com

## Sample Response (for GET /websites)

```json
{
  "www.facebook.com": "UP",
  "www.google.com": "UP",
  "www.fakewebsite1.com": "DOWN"
}
```
