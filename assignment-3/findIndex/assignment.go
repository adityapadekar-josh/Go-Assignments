# Find the Index of the Element

## Problem Description

Write a program to store the days of the week (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday) against the respective index of the day (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) in a map. You can hard-code the map in your program.

Take an integer input from the user and print the day stored against that index. If no day is found for that index, print "Not a day".

### Hint:

In Go, you can use the following code to take an integer input from the user:

```go
var index int
fmt.Scanln(&index)
```

### Example Test Cases:

#### Input:
```
5
```

#### Output:
```
Friday
```

#### Input:
```
11
```

#### Output:
```
Not a day
```
